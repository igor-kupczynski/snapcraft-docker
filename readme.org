* igor-kupczynski/snapcraft

Up to date version of [[https://hub.docker.com/r/snapcore/snapcraft/][snapcore/snapcraft]] docker image.

This is needed because the official one ships (as of time of writing) with
outdated sources, so the first thing you need to do is =apt-get update=, which
takes time.

See also [[https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/building-the-snap-on-docker/6757/2][a relevant post on the snapcraft forum]].

** Usage

To build a snap using a container from this image:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  $ docker pull ikupczynski/snapcraft:stable-2018-11-09
  $ docker run --rm -it -v "$PWD:/build" -w /build ikupczynski/snapcraft:stable-2018-11-09
  # snapcraft
#+END_SRC
